For a **Java backend developer with 3 years of experience**, youâ€™re expected to go **beyond basics** and demonstrate **real-world architectural, optimization, and team-level skills**.

Hereâ€™s a **complete list of must-know topics** for a 3-year experienced Java Spring Boot developer:

---

## âœ… 1. Core Java â€“ Mastery Level

You should **not just know**, but be able to explain, compare, and optimize.

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Topics:

* Deep knowledge of **OOP principles** & design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Builder)
* **Collections Framework** (Map, Set, List, Queue, NavigableMap)

    * Internal workings of HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap, TreeMap, etc.
* **Multithreading & Concurrency**

    * Thread lifecycle, Runnable vs Callable
    * `ExecutorService`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`
    * Synchronization, `volatile`, `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`
* **Java 8+ Features** (Proficient)

    * Lambdas, Streams (parallel streams)
    * Functional interfaces
    * Optional, DateTime API
* **Memory management**

    * JVM internals
    * GC tuning (basic)
    * Memory leaks and profiling (optional)

---

## âœ… 2. Spring Boot â€“ Real-World Proficiency

> Build RESTful APIs efficiently, modularly, and scalably.

### ðŸ”¹ Must-Have:

* **REST API Design**

    * Versioning, pagination, filtering
    * Request validation
* **Spring MVC** â€“ Controllers, Model/DTOs, Exception Handling
* **Dependency Injection** â€“ Qualifiers, Profiles, Scopes
* **Custom annotations** with AOP (`@Around`, `@Before`, `@After`)
* **Error Handling**

    * `@ControllerAdvice`, global exception handler, custom exceptions
* **Request Validation**

    * Bean Validation: `@Valid`, `@NotNull`, `@Pattern`, etc.

---

## âœ… 3. Spring Data JPA & Hibernate

* Entity mapping: `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@JoinTable`, cascading
* Lazy vs Eager fetching
* Native vs JPQL queries
* Projection & DTO mapping
* Batch inserts/updates
* N+1 problem & solutions (`@EntityGraph`, fetch joins)

---

## âœ… 4. SQL + Database Design

* Writing complex joins, indexing, normalization
* Query optimization techniques
* Transaction management (ACID)
* Stored procedures (optional)

---

## âœ… 5. Spring Security (JWT, Role-based Auth)

* Authentication vs Authorization
* JWT-based login and token refresh
* Custom UserDetailsService
* Secure APIs with role-based access (`@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`)
* CSRF, CORS config

---

## âœ… 6. Testing & Quality

* Unit Testing: JUnit 5, Mockito
* Integration Testing: `@SpringBootTest`
* Testcontainers (optional)
* REST-assured for API testing (bonus)
* Code coverage with JaCoCo

---

## âœ… 7. CI/CD + Build Tools

* **Maven/Gradle** (multi-module support)
* CI/CD pipeline basics (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
* Dockerize Spring Boot app
* Environment-based deployment
* `application-{env}.properties`

---

## âœ… 8. Microservices Architecture (Highly Expected)

* REST-based microservices using Spring Boot
* **Service Communication**

    * RESTTemplate (old), WebClient (reactive), Feign Client
* **Spring Cloud**:

    * Eureka (Service Registry)
    * Config Server (centralized config)
    * Gateway (routing, filters)
    * Resilience4J (circuit breaker)
* **Distributed Logging** (Sleuth + Zipkin)
* Centralized logging (ELK Stack or similar)

---

## âœ… 9. Messaging & Caching

* Redis: Setup, caching strategies, TTL, eviction
* Kafka: Producer/Consumer (basics)
* RabbitMQ (optional)

---

## âœ… 10. Soft Skills & Practices

* Agile/Scrum
* Jira, Git flow (branching strategies)
* PR review best practices
* Writing clean, modular, and scalable code

---
