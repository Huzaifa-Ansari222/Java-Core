/*
üóëÔ∏è What Garbage Collector (GC) does:
-It marks that heap object as "eligible for garbage collection".
-But it doesn‚Äôt delete it instantly!
-The GC runs automatically at some later point (when JVM decides it's needed ‚Äî like low memory or idle time).
-Then it cleans up such unreferenced objects to free memory.

‚ùó Important Points:
-str = null does not immediately delete the object.
-GC only cleans up unreachable objects, not ones still referenced.
-You cannot manually force GC, but you can suggest it:
